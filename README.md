# Let's solve it

## Explanation

This project consists of several problems that I found interesting to solve. I split each cases into 3 sections, they are Problem, Analytic and Implementation. Each implementation consists of Pseudocode, Flowchart and Real Implementation by using several language programming, such as: **go, python, js, .net core, cpp, java, etc**.

## List of Problem

- [what-is-the-total-amount](./what-is-the-total-amount)
- [count-string-similarities-basedon-suffixes](./count-string-similarities-basedon-suffixes)
